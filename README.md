OtherEngine CORE
================

This is the core of OtherEngine, a custom very early in-development [Entity Component System](1)
game engine written in C# with the aim of being very modular and moddable. Rendering will be done
using [OpenTK](2) using the seperate module [OtherEngine.Graphics](3).
